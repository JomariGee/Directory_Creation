# Directory_Creation
Simple program to automate the creation of directories

![Dir.py Menu](https://github.com/JomariGee/Directory_Creation/blob/main/Dir.py-Usage.png?raw=true "Picture of dir.py menu").

# ✏️ Usage 
### Windows 🪟
- Copy dir.py to your preffered directory
- Double click to run program and create directories 

### Linux 🐧
Please don't use this on Linux lol

It would be faster to install WSDL on Windows and go from there!
(Made this just for fun)
